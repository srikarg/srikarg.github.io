srikarg.github.io
=================

My personal website. Visit [http://srikarg.github.io/](http://srikarg.github.io/) to view it!

# How do I clone it locally?

Just `git clone git@github.com:srikarg/srikarg.github.io.git .` in the folder where you want to clone it and then type `jekyll serve --watch` to host the site on a localhost server and refresh it as new changes are made.
