=================

My personal website. Visit [https://srikarg.github.io/](https://srikarg.github.io/) to view it!

# How do I clone it locally?

Run `git clone https://github.com/srikarg/srikarg.github.io.git` in the folder where you want to clone it. Then type `jekyll serve` to host the site on a localhost server and refresh it as new changes are made.
