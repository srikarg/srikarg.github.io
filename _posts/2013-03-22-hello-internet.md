I finally got around to setting up a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) based blog! Yay! It's really awesome! For all the developers out there, go try it! They have some great documentation to get you started. Also, click [here](http://erjjones.github.io/blog/How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day/) and [here](https://learn.andrewmunsell.com/learn/jekyll-by-example/) for some great tutorials on making your very own blog based on Jekyll! Anyways, I hope you find the content here helpful! Keep watch for many more posts in the future!
