The Internet provides several tools to enhance the daily workflows of web and software developers. The following are a few of my favorites. Feel free to include your own favorite tools in the comments!

# Editors

1. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
	Sublime Text is a popular editor among developers because it showcases several useful features, such as multiple cursors and incremental search. It is actively developed and as I write, a new version, [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), is coming out (currently in beta).

	Price: $70

2. [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
	Vim is a text editor that has a steep learning curve. Once you get accustomed to Vim, it will become an extremely powerful tool in your workflow.

	Price: Free

3. [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
	Brackets is an open source editor that is actively developed by Adobe. It has features such as a built-in live preview and lots of [extensions](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions) to extend the capabilities of the editor.

	Price: Free

4. [TextMate](http://macromates.com/)
	TextMate used to be a paid and closed-sourced editor. However, the company decided to make the project open-source on Github as of August 9, 2012. The editor used to be popular before others, such as Sublime Text, superseded it.

	Price: Free

# Extensions

1. [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe)
	Stylish is an extension that you can use to quickly edit the CSS of any website. It also allows you to save your custom CSS styles for future use.

2. [Web Developer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm)
	Web Developer is essentially a toolkit with various features to expedite the process of web development. For example, it can display class and id details for all the elements on the page or resize the browser to various widths and heights to test your responsive layout.

# Web Applications

1. [Chop](http://chopapp.com/)
	Chop allows you to send code snippets (like [gists](https://gist.github.com/)) to your friends! However, the key feature here is that your friend can comment on your code seamlessly, allowing you to make edits and fixes quickly.

2. [Dirty Markup](http://www.dirtymarkup.com/)
	Dirty Markup is a code formatter (or beautifier) for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
